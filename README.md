# CS348-Applied-Optimization

This repository contains Python implementations of various optimization algorithms, including Gradient Descent and Newton's Method, developed as part of the CS348: Applied Optimization course.

## ðŸ“š Overview

The course focuses on practical optimization techniques applicable in machine learning, data science, and engineering. This repository showcases implementations of foundational optimization methods, demonstrating their application and performance.

## ðŸ§ª Key Implementations

- **Gradient Descent**: An iterative method for finding the minimum of a function.
- **Newton's Method**: A root-finding algorithm that uses function values and derivatives.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the scripts:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ehrg1/CS348-Applied-Optimization.git
   cd CS348-Applied-Optimization
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Execute the desired script:
   ```bash
   python gradient&newton.py
   ```

## ðŸ§ª Usage
